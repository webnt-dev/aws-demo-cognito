# Introduction

Project contains several demo application showcasing use of AWS Cognito service.

## Prerequisities
1. AWS account (with ability to install CloudFormation)
2. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) connected to that account
3. Node 18 (or above)

Project uses [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/) for CloudFormation definition/deployment. But CDK is part of application (as Node module)
